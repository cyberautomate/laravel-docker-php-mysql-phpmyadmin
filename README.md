## This is Laravel ready Docker container

## Contents
- Laravel 9
- Composer 2.4
- Apache
- PHP 8.1
- MySQL 8
- PHPMyAdmin

## Build / usage instruction

1. To build the container you will first need [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed. I did this all on a Windows host but the process should be similar on MAC/Linux.

2. Clone the repository to a folder on the client. For the sake of clarity let's say we cloned the repo to c:\ which would result in a folder called c:\laravel-docker-php-mysql-phpmyadmin. You can change this to whatever you want.

The folder structure should look like this. The only files/folders here that are not part of the typical Laravel file structure are noted in the image below. All of the docker build specific configuations reside mostly in the **dockerfile** and the **docker-compose.yml**

3. Build the images and run the container
    - In Windows Terminal navigate to the folder where you downloaded everything and run ```docker-compose up --build```
    - Once complete you should see some output in the terminal similar to the image below.

4. Confirm the images are built and the containers are running in Docker Desktop, see the example images below

6. Access PHPmyAdmin to manage the Database here http://localhost:8001. Username and password are both ***root***
